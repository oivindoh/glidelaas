# glidelaas
First python project, while attempting to learn by doing (and mostly failing). Because actually reading documentation properly would be truly wrong.

Includes a super secret key that's as yet unused, along with terrible python-learner coding! Visible to everyone!

## TODO:
* Transition (again...) from SQLAlchemy to Flask-SQLAlchemy
* Merged Chart views (all systems in one chart for the dashboard view)
* Expand "API" to include all possible data
* De-uglify (work on a decent homegrown stylesheet). Spend a few days staring in awe at what people can do with CSS3 and JS these days. Then probably give up.
* PDLog integration for dashboard message feed
* Configurability for PDLog integration (events to monitor, etc)
