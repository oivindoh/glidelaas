# glidelaas
First python project, while attempting to learn by doing (and mostly failing). Because actually reading documentation properly would be truly wrong.

Supposed to become a sort of dashboard for some secret sauce projects. Named after the tool alligators apparently use to enter my office building and hung for some daddy steak.

Uses Flask framework, because Django induced severe headaches. Coded while being under constant barrages of 'DADDY LOOK! DADDY LOOK!'. Just wait until I get my revenge by forcing the little ones to learn python. Just wait...

Includes a super secret key that's as yet unused, along with terrible python-learner coding! Visible to everyone!

## TODO:
* Transition (again...) from SQLAlchemy to Flask-SQLAlchemy
* Merged Chart views (all systems in one chart for the dashboard view)
* Expand "API" to include all possible data
* De-uglify (work on a decent homegrown stylesheet). Spend a few days staring in awe at what people can do with CSS3 and JS these days. Then probably give up.
* PDLog integration for dashboard message feed
* Configurability for PDLog integration (events to monitor, etc)
